##Problem statement
Create a superhero hunter app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks are
allowed for Javascript (you can use any CSS framework like Bootstrap).


Features (No need for extra features, just make the listed features)

Home Page:
1. Fetch and display a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also
create a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query.
Suppose I type “bat” in the search box, it should show “batman”.
[ API example
https://gateway.marvel.com:443/v1/public/characters?ts=<time-sta
mp>&apikey=<public-key>&hash=<md5(ts+privateKey+publicKey)>]
2. Each search result of the superhero should have a favorite button, clicking on
which superhero should be added to “My favorite superheroes” (a list).
3. On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with
more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

Superhero Page:
1. Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, bio
and other information provided by the API (comics, events, series, stories, etc).

My favourite superheroes Page:
1. Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
2. Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before
and after closing the browser).
3. Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from
favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
